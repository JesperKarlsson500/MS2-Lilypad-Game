## UX
<hr>
The purpose of this game is to help anyone improve their memory while having a fun time. 
Put on the ambiant music in the game, sit back, relax and follow the frog from lily to lily. 
To help you remember what lilypad to jumped to, they are colored differently and have a unique splash sound
to them when you click them. 


### UX Stories

* As a user I want to have fun.
* As a user I want to follow patterns and improve my memory.
* As a user I want to learn in a relaxed and colorful inviroment
* As a user I want to easily pick up how the game works
* As a user I want to see how good my memory is.

A user for my Lilypad game is looking to improve their memory and have fun doing it.

## Strategy
<hr>

#### User Needs
Be fun, user friendly with clear navigation and flow through the whole experience.

#### Business vision
As a business I see the market being saturated with memory games. 
This doesn't mean it's a no go. There are possibilites with my frog themed Simon inspired game
but I would have to test it extensivly together with kids to see their reactions 
and if it's something they want.

## Scope
I want the user to be happy in a relaxed learning inviroment

## Structure
The game is made up of one page. 
It consists of six lilypads that light up in a randomized pattern. Every turn 
you complete the pattern increases by one until you reach the score of 15. 
At 15 you won the game.

## Wireframes
<hr>

I started making the game to look like the Simon game

I later on changed the look and and layout of the game to be more unique.
### Changes to wireframes

## Original ideas
<hr>

## Features
<hr>

* Start game button.
* on/off button for the ambiant music.
* Score counter if the middle of the lilyflower that increments after each succesful turn.
* after reaching 15 turns you win the game and "WIN!" will show up to replace the numbers
* All lilypads will flash their colors if you win the game (currently not working)
* A frog that introduces you to the game and keeps it's eyes on the mouse.


## Technologies
<hr>
This project was build using the following technologies:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Google Chrome DevTools: Helped me iterate, debug and profile my site.
* Lighthouse: Helped me improve the websites performance on both desktop and mobile.
* Jigsaw W3C validator: Validated and tested my CSS.
* W3C Markup validator: Validated and tested my HTML.

## Testing
<hr>
Changed splash sound on the red and yellow leaf since they sounded a bit harsh. 

The game doesn't reset when the win condition is met, So I need to fix that.

I found so far that if you win the game nothing happens. I will look into this.

### Testing plan

My testing plan is to play the game and make sure it works on desktop.
Any problems that comes up I will 

### Implementation

#### When using code validator I found:
