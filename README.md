## UX
<hr>
The purpose of this game is to help anyone improve their memory while having a fun time. 
Put on the ambiant music in the game, sit back, relax and follow the frog from lily to lily. 
To help you remember what lilypad to jumped to, they are colored differently and have a unique splash sound
to them when you click them. 


### UX Stories

* As a user I want to follow patterns and improve my memory.
* As a user I want to learn in a relaxed and colorful inviroment
* As a user I want to easily pick up how the game works
* As a user I want to see how good my memory is.

A user for my Lilypad game is looking to improve their memory and have fun doing it.

## Strategy
<hr>

#### User Needs
Be fun, user friendly with clear navigation and flow through the whole experience.

#### Business vision
As a business I see the market being saturated with memory games. 
This doesn't mean it's a no go. There are possibilites with my frog themed Simon inspired game
but I would have to test it extensivly together with kids to see their reactions 
and if it's something they want.

## Scope
I want the user to be happy in a relaxed learning inviroment

## Structure
The game is made up of one page.
